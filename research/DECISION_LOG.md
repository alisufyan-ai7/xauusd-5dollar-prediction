# Decision Log

This file records material project decisions and the reasoning that led to them.

It is intended to preserve continuity across chats and prevent silent changes to the research design.

---

## D-001 — Clean-room project isolation

Decision:
Use only this project repository, this project's chat context, and fresh public research/data.

Reason:
Prevent contamination from unrelated XAU/USD projects, strategies, code, assumptions, and prior conclusions.

---

## D-002 — Probability framing instead of certainty

Decision:
Model the probability that +$5 occurs before -$3 within 60 minutes for BUY, and the symmetric condition for SELL.

Reason:
Markets cannot provide genuine certainty. A probabilistic framing is measurable and compatible with calibration and abstention.

---

## D-003 — NO TRADE is a first-class outcome

Decision:
The prediction system may abstain.

Reason:
Forcing a fixed number of daily trades would bias the system toward low-quality states. A disciplined expert trader waits when no sufficiently strong setup exists.

---

## D-004 — M1 decision semantics

Decision:
Use the close of the current M1 bar as the reference price and begin outcome scanning from the next M1 bar.

Reason:
Prevents use of the decision bar's future high/low information and creates deterministic timestamp semantics.

---

## D-005 — Ambiguous same-minute barrier touches

Decision:
If target and adverse barrier are both touched inside the same M1 bar and ordering cannot be proven, mark the outcome AMBIGUOUS.

Reason:
Do not invent intra-minute event ordering from OHLC data.

---

## D-006 — Free public Dukascopy M1 feed

Decision:
Use free public Dukascopy XAU/USD M1 BID history as the primary historical source.

Reason:
It provides long historical coverage suitable for the initial feasibility study without paid data.

---

## D-007 — Historical acquisition window

Decision:
Use calendar years 2016-2025 for historical research.

Reason:
Ten years provides varied volatility and macro regimes while remaining operationally manageable.

2026 remains outside historical development.

---

## D-008 — Chronological partitions

Decision:

- TRAIN: 2016-2021
- VALIDATION: 2022
- DEVELOPMENT_TEST: 2023-2024
- FINAL_OOS: 2025

Reason:
Preserve chronological realism and maintain a genuinely untouched final out-of-sample year.

---

## D-009 — 2025 FINAL_OOS seal

Decision:
Do not expose or use 2025 outcome distributions during feature/model/threshold development.

Reason:
Opening 2025 early would turn the final OOS into another development set.

---

## D-010 — Dataset hash lock

Decision:
Pin every admitted yearly raw chunk by SHA-256 and row count.

Reason:
A later independent acquisition returned a 2020 file missing 120 rows while still passing structural validation. A subsequent targeted retry reproduced the original 2020 file exactly. Structural validation alone is therefore insufficient for research reproducibility.

---

## D-011 — Expert-trader observation principle

Decision:
Design the system to observe market context in the style of a disciplined expert human XAU/USD trader, but convert those observations into objective timestamp-safe variables and verify them statistically.

Reason:
Human experts consider context that simple single-indicator systems miss: higher timeframe structure, location, volatility, momentum, session, event risk, multi-timeframe alignment, and confluence.

The machine should preserve that breadth of observation while avoiding human emotional and cognitive weaknesses.

---

## D-012 — Expert concepts are hypotheses, not truths

Decision:
No human trading concept is accepted merely because traders commonly use it.

Reason:
Every feature or setup concept must demonstrate value through chronological validation, calibration, robustness, and later untouched OOS evidence.

---

## D-013 — Durable project context belongs in GitHub

Decision:
Material brainstorming conclusions, architectural rationale, project state, and research decisions must be recorded in this repository rather than existing only in ChatGPT conversation history.

Reason:
Future chats must be able to continue the project without depending on account-level memory or inaccessible prior-chat reasoning.

Operational rule:
After material decisions, update the decision log, relevant specification, and continuity summary.


---

## D-014 — Separate deterministic CI from historical reacquisition

Decision:
Automatic push/pull-request CI runs only deterministic repository tests. Public-data downloads, full-history reacquisition, dataset-lock reproduction checks, and long diagnostics are moved to a manually dispatched historical-data-integrity workflow.

Reason:
The public Dukascopy feed can return transient or changed historical snapshots that fail the pinned dataset lock even when repository code is correct. Re-running expensive network-dependent acquisition on every documentation or code commit created misleading red workflow runs and consumed unnecessary Actions capacity.

Operational rule:
- `.github/workflows/foundation-checks.yml` is automatic and deterministic.
- `.github/workflows/historical-data-integrity.yml` is manual and network/data dependent.
- A historical reacquisition mismatch is treated as a data-integrity event, not a code-regression failure.
